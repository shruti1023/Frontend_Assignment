# Project Description 
The React application will have two main components: the JSON editor component and the form preview component. The JSON editor component will allow users to paste the UI-Schema in JSON format on the left-hand side. The form preview component will automatically render the form based on the pasted UI-Schema and display it on the right-hand side.
